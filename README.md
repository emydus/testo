# MWayComms dataset

To use this repository, clone it and run the files / analysis of interest.

## File organisation:
All data files should be placed in the *"data"* folder, and so all code should target this folder.

I've set up .gitignore files to ignore the data files as well as any produced results.

**DO NOT** push data files to the repository.

Happy coding! :+1:

## Tasklist:
* Merge everything in a more coherent way, i.e splitting functions and different types of analysis into different folders and modules.

* Look into principal component analysis during winter break

* Incorporate weather data from Jamie

*Eloisa: some ideas*
* Flow, over or under some threshold, possibility of speed being some other threshold ? + other variables
* Facebook prophet - comparison between self-made model and prophet model

Summary of existing work done:

Titus
* Animation of plots into .avi

Tom
* Bunch of plots (avg_speed vs time), (flow over time), total number of cars, comparison across carriageways.

Eloisa
* Initial data read-in into python pandas (similar to R)
* Facebook prophet analysis: comparison to own code
