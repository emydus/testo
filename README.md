# 28/11/2018
Changelog
- Merged everything into master

Tasklist:
Summarise what everyone is doing and merge everything in a more coherent way, i.e splitting functions and different types of analysis into different folders

File organisation:
All data files should be placed in the "data" folder, and so all code should target this folder.

I've set up .gitignore files to ignore the data files as well as any produced results.

DO NOT push data files to the repository.
