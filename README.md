# MWayComms dataset

To use this repository, clone it and run the files / analysis of interest.

## File organisation

All data files should be placed in the *"data"* folder, and so all code should target this folder. Natural Earth map data for use with geopandas has been placed in *"maps"* and weather data provided by Eloisa has been placed in *"weather"*.

I've set up .gitignore files to ignore the data files as well as any produced results.

**DO NOT** push data files to the repository.

Happy coding! :+1:
