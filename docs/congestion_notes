# Notes on congestion

 Rough analysis of animations of flow/speed/occupancy/headway against sensor:
 - Flow doesn't show dramatic enough fluctuations for any conclusions to be drawn
 - Headway is too erratic at all times of day
 - Speed and occupancy much more useful parameters

 Suggested thresholds to define various levels of traffic congestion:

 Speed:
 - Heavy Traffic: 60 km/h
 - Congestion: < 45 km/h
 - Heavy Congestion: < 35 km/h

 Occupancy:
 - Heavy Traffic: 35
 - Congestion: 50
 - Heavy Congestion: > 60
