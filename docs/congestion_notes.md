# Notes on congestion

## Rough analysis of animations of flow/speed/occupancy/headway against sensor

- Flow doesn't show dramatic enough fluctuations for any conclusions to be drawn
- Headway is too erratic at all times of day
- Speed and occupancy much more useful parameters

## Suggested thresholds to define various levels of traffic congestion

### Speed

- Heavy Traffic: 60 km/h
- Congestion: < 45 km/h
- Heavy Congestion: < 35 km/h

### Occupancy

- Heavy Traffic: 35
- Congestion: 50
- Heavy Congestion: > 60
