# Essential project goals

Lots of statistical analysis, leading to;

- Visualization
  - 3D plots (Plotly,Bokeh,matplotlib)
- Predictive models
  - More theoretically, building a traffic flow model
  - Sources / sinks of cars, only certain roads are covered
  - sigma clipping (i.e error tolerance)
  - eventually maybe being able to insert "fake" data
  - Parameterising
  - beware overfitting
- Catching incorrect data from faulty sensors
- Effects of external factors (weather, large public events in the vicinity)
